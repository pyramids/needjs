MESSAGE_MIN="Minified and gzipped size is \`$SIZE_MIN\` bytes (auto-updated on $DATE), after removal of development support such as console.log output."

MESSAGE_BOOT="If that is too much for you, there is a bootstrap version that minifies and gzips down to \`$BOOTSTRAP_SIZE_MIN\` bytes whilst compromising only on speed, not on functionality (invocations using unsupported functionality are deferred and should work as soon as the full version has been loaded)."

#MESSAGE="Without this removal and slightly less agressive minification/gzipping, the size would be \`$SIZE\` bytes."
