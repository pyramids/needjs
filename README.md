Statistics
------

Minified and gzipped size is `1243` bytes (auto-updated on Thu May  1 10:52:17 UTC 2014), after removal of development support such as console.log output. Without this removal and slightly less agressive minification/gzipping, the size would be `1492` bytes.

The minified script is not included to discourage production use: This script is largely untested and I wish to encourage you to obtain the maximum debug information. Please contribute bug fixes.
