Statistics
------

Minified and gzipped size is `1080` bytes (auto-updated on Tue Apr 29 11:59:37 UTC 2014), after removal of development support such as console.log output. Without this removal and slightly less agressive minification/gzipping, the size would be `1445` bytes.

The minified script is not included to discourage production use: This script is largely untested and I wish to encourage you to obtain the maximum debug information. Please contribute bug fixes.
