Statistics
------

Minified and gzipped size is `1059` bytes (auto-updated on Mon Apr 28 15:24:35 UTC 2014), after removal of development support such as console.log output. Without this removal and slightly less agressive minification/gzipping, the size would be `1408` bytes.

The minified script is not included to discourage production use: This script is largely untested and I wish to encourage you to obtain the maximum debug information. Please contribute bug fixes.
